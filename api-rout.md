I'll examine the CSV file to understand the data structure and then suggest basic API endpoints for your IPL data. Let me check the file size and try reading a smaller portion: The file is quite large (62MB). Let me examine the first few rows to understand the structure: The data appears to be normalized/scaled. Let me also check if there are other CSV files that might have the raw data: Based on the CSV file structures, here are the basic API endpoints I would suggest for your IPL data API:
